					<p class="intro">Hi! I'm David Tam</p>
					<p>I am an experienced software developer living in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
					<p>I previously worked in the software industry for over 18 years and now I own a home-based
						pickup delivery
						business.</p>
					<p>To support my business needs, I developed a very elaborate billing and route management
						system using the
						following technologies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>PHP</li>
						<li>MYSQL</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>AJAX</li>

			<h2>About me</h2>
			<div class="group">
				<div class="item item-double">
					<p>
						After graduating college, I became a software engineer and I had been working on all kinds of
						projects. Mostly on the front end, database and network management side of things. I had joined
						a dry cleaning franchise in 2002 and then opened my own dry cleaning company in 2008, which I
						have been working at to this day. To support my business needs, I actively work on coding
						projects using all kinds of technologies. The custom software I created was very easy to use,
						feature rich and very reliable, It handling accounts for hundreds of my customers. I found
						software development very interesting, rewarding and challenging. Due to the pandemic, I found
						myself have much more time than before. Therefore, I would like to get my coding skill set more
						up to date and find a job besides what I am doing now.
					</p>

					<p>
						As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>,
						I've learned a lot of techniques to become a much better software developer and I cannot wait to
						apply what I learn to the projects I will be working on.
					</p>

					<p>
						In my spare time, I like to go hiking, biking, kayaking, fishing, watch Netflix and football.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you're looking to hire an experienced developer, please reach out! I am so excited to work
						with other developers to build great software.
